# Wheat yield predictor

This is a web app that uses gradient boosting to predict wheat yield and gross production in any country.

## Steps
- Use meteorological data to reliably predict wheat yield and gross production in any country
- Extract relevant information from international crop statistics in order to clearly visualize important aspects of worldwide wheat production
- Create a web app to make this data available online and able to be freely manipulated by users to support custom predictions

For every country, a single set of GPS coordinates was used to get the temperature from the open-meteo climate API.
For most countries, the coordinates of the geographical center of the country (geocode/user agent: ‘google v3’) was used.
Exceptions : coordinates entered manually for major producers which have a large surface area (USA, Canada, etc). We used GPS coordinates of the most important wheat-producing regions in these countries.

## Machine learning model
Model used: Gradient Boosting Regressor

Model metrics :
- Train R² : 0.9821
- Test R² : 0.9351
- Train MSE : 5964117.1834

- Year : num. feature (productivity)
- Average temperature : the average of mean temperatures (in °C) over a given growth period (period going from september of the previous year to june of the current year)
- Heat/cold wave[1][2] number : number of heat/cold waves over the growth period
- Heat/cold wave magnitude : average magnitude of heat/cold waves over the growth period

Predictions can be made until 2050 using climate forecasting from the openmeteo API.
Users can provide their own climate predictions in the custom mode and choose among 4 scenari (or choose a fully customized prediction).
